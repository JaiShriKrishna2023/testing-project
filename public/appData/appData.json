            "description1": "Jan-23::Hello Friends, this incident which I am telling you has happened to me on 23/01/2023.\nMy advocate called me over phone on 21st Jan and said that my wife is regretting and wants to come back with me but before hearing she wants to talk together once.I replied that only me and my wife will discuss and no one will interfere and advocates of both sides will be present there if they want but their family members should not come in between, my lawyer assures me that no one will not hinder.\nI agreed and I reached Prayagraj on 23rd where I booked Hotel Sundaram and from there I called my advocate, he told me to come to the court at 3:30.\nI reached to the court , there opposite side  advocate told to my advocate that it would take some time and when my advocate asked him who has come, then he replied that only her brother Krishna soni and wife along with daughter.\nBut I didn't know that my advocate is meeting him and planning for me.\nCourt closing time at 4 o'clock so after court closing my advocate insisted me to meet my wife at home that she will come there with her advocate and brother Krishna and you and wife both will come in front of advocate will discuss if there is any problem. After talking to my advocate, I went with him to his house, there after waiting for some time my wife comes with her family. \nI  was waiting in his meeting room on the first floor with my Advocate, and suddenly my wife's brother Rajeev Soni, Krishna Soni, opposite counsel and their assistants, my Counsel Assistant and another unknown person came and my wife and her sister Priyanka soni was waiting at ground floor and later my wife came in meeting room.My wife's brother Rajeev Soni started levelling false allegations against me and brother Krishna Soni threatened to kill me.\nMy advocate started stopping me from presenting in front and he said that 'Ye ladki wale hain tujhe chahe to bhangi bana denge' and my wife was sitting there and she was listening silently when her brother was threatening to kill me.\nI bought a jacket for my daughter that day and want to give it to her but when I requested to meet, then on my second time request my wife brought it in front of me and I gave her jacket and you guys cannot imagine that how much I was emotional to see my daughter but they allowed me to meet her for around 15-20 min only.\nThis conversation was started around 6:15pm and ended around 9:30pm and they tried hard to pressure me.\nI was alone and went to bring my wife and daughter but I didn't complain after the way her brothers misbehaved even I did not tell to my family members about this incidence that day.\nI just shared with one of my friend in case if any incident will happen with me then he can share.\nJan-24::nIn morning I reached to court and it was my first hearing and also it was first in serial number as well that day, and my counsel said to me if you will say anything without my permission in front of judge then it will not be good.\nIn hearing when judge started hearing, opposite counsel said that it is the placement of section 9 and some negotiation going on between both parties, husband and wife along with daughter present before court.\nThe judge gave us the date of February 14 to take the wife along as per our advocate request.\nAs soon as my wife counsel came out of the court, her lawyer's first word was that  wife's presence was established, his work is done, now there is no need to go and my lawyer did not put any point in front of the judge from my end that why since 8 months she is with her husband, not living together and my advocate nor let me speak.\nThen only the lawyer asked to walk in the court chamber to discuss, there again his brother Rajeev Soni, Krishna Soni, sister Priyanka Soni came and started doing the same acts to pressurize me and only the lawyer's junior Chandra Bhushan Kushwaha came to me I was doing silence again and again and suddenly I saw that his sister Priyanka Soni was recording all this in her mobile so that I can show my relatives a good way to silence me. I spent some time there and later came out and they agreed that my wife will come on 14th feb and will come along with me in Bangalore.conclusion: It is clear that they were wrong and want to make proof in recording by make me in pressure.\nThey did voice recording on 23rd Jan where his brother threaten me and cyber team can prove this if court want that prove.\nHer actual intension was not to return and they want that anyhow this case can be withdraw."
